          for small organizations, community groups, and
          nonprofits. It helps you easily track your available
          items and clearly show what you need â€” all in real time.
          Donors can instantly see what is in short supply and
          give directly to the causes that matter most. Giving
          becomes more focused, more meaningful, and more effective.
