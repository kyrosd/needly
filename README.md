# Needly

Needly is a simple, public inventory tool built for small organizations, community groups, and nonprofits. It helps you easily track your available items and clearly show what you need â€” all in real time. Donors can instantly see what is in short supply and give directly to the causes that matter most. Giving becomes more focused, more meaningful, and more effective.
